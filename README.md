simple react-native integration with Siri and google assistant

I developed Siri extension and Google Action Slice to get command from them, but I can not send it to React. After that, React must return a simple text message as a result to Siri and Google.
There is problems on integration of Siri and Google assistant with React-native.
You can find my comment(android version) in android/app/src/main/java/com/simplevoice/MySliceProvider.java line 68.
You can also find my comment(ios version) in ios/CommandIntent/GetCommandInentHandler.swift line 21.
